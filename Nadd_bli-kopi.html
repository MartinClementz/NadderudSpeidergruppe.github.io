                    <p> In years past, many sites would link to the Acrobat Reader Web site to help people who may not have this software to download it so they could view your file. The reality is that current web browsers will actually <br>show PDF documents in-line. This means that they do not, by default, download them to the user's computer, but instead show them directly in that browser. Because of this, it is not as necessary today to include the link to download the software, but if you prefer to do so, it certainly<br> cannot hurt (it may make your site feel a bit dated, however)</p>
